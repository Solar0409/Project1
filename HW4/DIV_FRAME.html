            William Shakespeare (bapt.Tooltip baptised 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor.
            He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.
            He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations,
            consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have
            been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains
            arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.

            Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
            In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
            From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
            Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
            From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
            A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
            Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
            Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
            The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
            And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
            Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
            Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
            The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
            What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

Why, such is love's transgression.<br>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br>
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown<br>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;<br>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br>
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:<br>
What is it else? a madness most discreet,<br>
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.<br>
Farewell, my coz.</p>
